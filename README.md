# Automated API Testing with Python, Requests, and Pytest 🤖🐍

This project provides a structure and tools for automated API testing using Python, Requests, and Pytest, following Data-Driven Testing (DDT) best practices and employing the Service Object Model design pattern.

## Testing Swagger Petstore User Management Endpoints 🧪

This suite of tests is focused on validating and testing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to user management within the Swagger Petstore API (Base URL: https://petstore.swagger.io). Specifically, the tests interact with the following endpoints:

- Create User (POST): Endpoint URL: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user
- Get User (GET): Endpoint URL: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}
- Update User (PUT): Endpoint URL: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}
- Delete User (DELETE): Endpoint URL: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}

These tests are designed to ensure the functionality and correctness of these user management endpoints provided by the Swagger Petstore API. They interact with the defined URLs in the Routes class to perform comprehensive testing of user-related functionalities.
